# Projects.
This Repository contains my Python Developer and Machine learning Projects. 

## Python Developer Projects: 
Following projects are written in python:

### 1.checkmypass.py:

This is a Password Checker Project. This project contains the most legitamate way for you to check whether your password have been hacked(released under Data Breaches) ever.

### 2.scrape.py:

This is a Webscraping project aims at displaying only those news from hackers news which has a score of more than 100 in descending order. 

## Machine Learning projects:

Following are Machine learning and Data Science Projects written using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
Following notebooks looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of:
